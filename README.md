# Same same but different FCD IIb vs. TSC â€“ distinct histomorphological features revealed with the help of deep learning
## Introduction
This ipynb-notebook helps reproduce our pipeline for the publication above. The code provided features part of our pipeline (preprocessing, training and visualization), but not the whole analysis and end-to-end described software solution.

## System requirements

We would suggest to create a new environment with the described dependencies. 

## Hardware requirements
Our experiments were carried out on 2x NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080Ti using an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X 16x 3.40GHz, 128Gb RAM, CUDA 10.0 and cuDNN 7.

## Using the code
While running the code all filepaths need to be specified as described in the notebook.
